## Who am I?

Hi, I'm Thibault Monnier. I mainly code in [Typescript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript) for web development. I am currently learning [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)). I know a bit of [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)) though I never really coded anything myself with it. I also know web languages such as [Javascipt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS).

I am also a member of the [Eagle Tech organization](https://github.com/Eagletech-robotic), the codebase of the Eagle Tech robotics club.
